### Abstract
The research is aimed at exploring and measuring the factors impacting on the number and volume of sales from orders made for imports and export trading. Notably, the research involves the development of a series of a model for examining the impact of the various selected variables on the sales variable. To accomplish the research, the initial strep is the development of the discussions around the models and then the analysis of the dataset with 180519 valid observations and 53 variables. The main variables used for modelling in this research include sales, discount, product price, total amount, and sales for each individual customer. The outcome from the exploratory analysis demonstrates that all the predictor variables have significant positive impacts on the sales amounts. In the result, the product price has the highest influence on the value of sales, while the order discount has the least influence on the sales. In addition, this research demonstrates that the product price significantly effects the customerâ€™s decision on product order placement for cargo delivery. Since customers are mostly influenced by the prices, this research recommends necessary reforms on the management policies and executive decisions to maximize customerâ€™s satisfaction and decision to increase the sales level. It also provides support for new innovations and further research works in new related areas.

### Data set
The analysis was based on the DataCo Supply Chain Data ([Link](
